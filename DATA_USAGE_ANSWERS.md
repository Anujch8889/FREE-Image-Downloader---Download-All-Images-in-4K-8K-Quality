## IF THEY ASK FOR MORE DETAILS:

**Question:** "How does your extension work without collecting data?"

**Answer:**
```
This extension processes everything locally in the user's browser. When a user 
clicks "Scan For Images", the extension analyzes the current webpage's HTML 
structure to find images, identifies the highest quality versions, and allows 
the user to download them. All of this happens entirely within the user's 
browser without any data being sent to external servers or stored anywhere. 
The extension has no backend servers, no analytics, and no data transmission 
of any kind.
```
