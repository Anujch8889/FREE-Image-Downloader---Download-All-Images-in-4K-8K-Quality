🎯 Works On All Websites:

✅ Design portfolios (Behance, Dribbble)
✅ Stock photo sites
✅ Any website with images!

🔥 What Makes Us Different:

Unlike other image downloaders that only grab the currently displayed image, our extension intelligently analyzes the webpage source code to find the absolute highest quality version available - even if it's not currently visible on screen.

Most websites use responsive images (srcset) that serve different quality versions based on screen size. Regular downloaders miss these high-quality versions. Our extension automatically selects the 4K or 8K version, ensuring you always get the best quality.

⭐ Advanced Technology:

• Srcset parsing: Finds hidden high-resolution variants
• Lazy loading detection: Captures images not yet loaded
• CSS background extraction: Downloads images from stylesheets
• URL normalization: Handles relative and absolute paths
• Duplicate prevention: Filters out tracking pixels and duplicates
• Smart size filtering: Excludes tiny icons and favicons

📊 Supported Image Formats:

✓ JPG/JPEG (standard photos)
✓ PNG (lossless, transparency)
✓ GIF (animated images)
✓ WebP (modern efficient format)
✓ SVG (vector graphics)
✓ BMP (bitmap images)
✓ TIFF (high-quality format)
✓ AVIF (next-generation format)
✓ ICO (icon files)
